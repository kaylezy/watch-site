    <p>Watches
        Tick tock. You’ll never wonder what time it is again when you browse through all watches, including designer brands like Victorinox Swiss Army, GUESS, Gucci and Burberry. From stainless steel and ceramic watch straps to leather and fabric ones, you’ll find the perfect fit for your wrist.
        
        Want a watch that’s both practical and fashionable? Look for straps in vibrant colors like pink, purple or bright white. Watch faces with diamond accents or larger font numbers exude fabulous, bold style, while watch straps in silver-tone or gold-tone stainless steel punctuate the subtle nuances of the watch.
        
        For the sports enthusiast, Smart Watches are a great way to time yourself and always keep track of your steps and more. Key athletic features like water resistance, date and time, a stretchy watch strap and quartz movement make you primed to take on any sport!
        
        Chronograph watches make it easy to tell time precisely, with stick indices that can tell you—down to the second—what time it is. All watches of this type are elegantly crafted, often with ceramic turning bezels that lend the watch an ornate, delicate appearance.
        
        The worlds of watches and fashion jewelry collide when you Opt For Women’s Watches from brands like Kate Spade and Fitbit. Watch bracelets also make your style look ultra chic—and they’re not as bulky as regular watches. Watch straps in feminine colors such as rose gold or white gold add a graceful touch as well.
        
        Solar watches are another option for those who want to energize their watch collection. Powered by a solar panel, these watches are environmentally friendly and ideal for the seasoned outdoorsman. They also require minimal maintenance because they don’t need a battery or have to be wound.
